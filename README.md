Optimizing Marketing Tactics with Consumer Grouping and Recommendation Systems

Project Overview

This project aims to enhance online retail marketing strategies by leveraging customer segmentation and personalized recommendation systems. The goal is to analyze customer purchasing behaviors, segment them into meaningful groups, and provide tailored product recommendations to increase customer engagement and sales.

Objectives

Customer Segmentation: Using K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors.
Recommendation System: Developing a personalized recommendation system using traditional and advanced techniques like Word2Vec.
User Interface: Implementing a user-friendly interface with Gradio to interact with the recommendation system.
Materials and Methods

Materials
Data: E-commerce transaction data including customer purchases, product descriptions, and purchasing frequency.
Tools: Python programming language, Scikit-Learn, YellowBrick, Gensim libraries, and Gradio for interface development.
Methods
Data Preprocessing:
Handling duplicates, cancelled transactions, and anomalies.
Exclusion of outliers to focus on the core customer base.
Feature Engineering:
Creation of behavioral metrics.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.
Clustering:
K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.
Evaluation:
Analysis of clustering results using silhouette scores, Calinski-Harabasz scores, and Davies-Bouldin scores.
Recommendation System:
Development of a personalized product recommendation system using Word2Vec.
User Interface:

Implementation of a Gradio interface to allow users to interact with the recommendation system by entering CustomerIDs for personalized suggestions.
